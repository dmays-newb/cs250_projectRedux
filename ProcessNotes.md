# Process Notes
## After planning takes place...
- Here's a decent way to get going.
    - Create or import generic utilities:
        - Text and/or number entry and validations
        - Tools to check that data is in desired range
    - Then create a framework for appropriate data flow 
        - Don't leave important data flows to deal with later.
        - Have an idea of where data is going and how you're going to get further along in the program.

- This way, you aren't wasting your time recreating simple tools and can focus on the overall structure and flow of data.
